🌟 Reflecting back to my first ever Hackpad, the experience was awesome and engaging to experience! 
🧠 Many mistakes were learned and it was an enjoyable time learning the fundamentals of schematics, PCB design, and 3D cadding :D

⌨️ With the experience and fundamentals, I want to dive further into keyboard design with a new design... YippeePad v2!
🌻 Instead of making a macropad, I am planning to build a slightly modified 75% keyboard.

Here's what was done so far!!

Planning:

# June 4: Let's have some fun! 🤩

🏝️ Brainstorming with themes, I wanted the keyboard to have a tropical beach theme as we are heading into the awesome summer break!
🦈 Possibly including a cool shark inprint to the back of the keyboard, contributing to a cool vibe :)

🎨 Here are some themes and design I would like to incorporate within my keyboard design!
